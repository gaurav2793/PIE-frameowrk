PIE-frameowrk
=============

A Javascript framework using the createjs library. Used to display animations on HTML5 canvas.

Purpose: As a part of my job at Summer Internship at IIT-Mumbai in 2014.
Features:
1. Same feel and layout for all the experiments.
2. Any object like rectangle, triangle or polygon can be drawn with about 2-3 lines of code.
3. Supports animations.

How to use?
Along with all the classes, you need to import createjs library in your "main.html" file. A documentation is provided along side that contains details of each class.

Components of any experiment:
  1. PIE classes : Fixed
  2. createjs library : Fixed
  3. main.html : Fixed
  4. Experiment.js (in Assets) : that actually creates the required animation.

Experiment.js : 
1. Variable declaration
2. Variable Initialisation
3. Creating Experiment Objects
4. Animations(in the nextFrame() function)

Look at the example and documentation for more detals.
